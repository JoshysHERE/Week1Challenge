# <Horiseon Website Project>

## Description

I was given the task to find issues in the code and comment on anything i might find while keeping the integrity of the website.

In this project i found that there was no title on the website Tab.

Most of the tags that were used were div tags. I ended up changing most of them to tags that made more sense based on were they were.

There were extra lines of code on the CSS that did not match with anything on the HTML.

I didn't find any comments on the HTML or CSS so i left some to help understand what this means.
